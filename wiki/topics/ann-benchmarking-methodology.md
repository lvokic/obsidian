# ANN Benchmarking Methodology

## Summary

ANN evaluation should separate three questions that are often mixed together:

- **Implementation benchmarking:** how a concrete implementation performs under a standardized harness.
- **Algorithm/component analysis:** which graph, routing, pruning, seeding, or construction component causes the performance.
- **System benchmarking:** how performance changes when vectors move across DRAM, GPU HBM, SSD, CXL, or other tiers under static or streaming workloads.

[ANN-Benchmarks](../entities/ann-benchmarks.md) anchors the first question. [Graph-Based ANNS Survey 2021](../source-notes/graph-based-anns-survey-2021.md) anchors the second. [FLANN](../entities/flann.md) and [FALCONN](../entities/falconn.md) anchor important non-graph baseline families, while [NN-Descent](../entities/nn-descent.md), [EFANNA](../entities/efanna.md), [FANNG](../entities/fanng.md), [DPG](../entities/diversified-proximity-graph.md), and [NGT/ONNG](../entities/ngt-onng.md) provide primary-source coverage for graph components. [SVFusion](../entities/svfusion.md), [SPFresh](../entities/spfresh.md), [OdinANN](../entities/odinann.md), [BANG](../entities/bang.md), [GustANN](../entities/gustann.md), and [FusionANNS](../entities/fusionanns.md) show why the third needs additional metrics beyond in-memory recall-QPS.

## Metric Layers

| Layer | Metrics | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Query quality | Recall@k, epsilon recall, distance ratio, position-aware error | Use matched recall when comparing throughput or latency. |
| Query speed | QPS, p50/p95/p99 latency, batch QPS, single-query latency | Batch mode and online latency should be reported separately. |
| Preprocessing | build time, index memory, construction memory peak | Graph methods may dominate high recall but have expensive builds. |
| Updates | insertion throughput, deletion throughput, repair/rebuild cost, recall drift, latency fluctuation under update load | Static ANN-Benchmarks-style results do not measure freshness or merge interference. |
| Graph structure | average degree, graph quality, path length, connectivity, candidate set size | Graph quality alone does not imply better search performance. |
| Memory tiers | DRAM footprint, GPU HBM usage, SSD I/O, PCIe transfer, cache miss rate, cost/QPS | Required for SSD/GPU/CXL/disaggregated-memory claims. |

## Practical Rules

- Plot Pareto frontiers at matched quality. Speed claims without recall alignment are weak.
- Report implementation identity. ANN-Benchmarks warns that benchmarking an implementation is not the same as benchmarking an abstract algorithm.
- Separate build parameters from query parameters. Large graph indexes often improve high-recall robustness but increase build time and memory.
- Avoid one-dataset conclusions. The graph survey shows that algorithm rankings can change sharply across datasets.
- Keep non-graph baselines in scope. FLANN and FALCONN are still useful for tree/auto-tuning and angular LSH comparisons even when graph methods dominate high recall.
- Do not use in-memory ANN-Benchmarks results as direct evidence for SSD, CXL, RDMA, or GPU-out-of-HBM behavior.
- For graph papers, map claims onto components: initialization, candidate acquisition, neighbor selection, seed preprocessing, connectivity, seed acquisition, and routing.
- For KNNG-based methods, separate the cost of building the approximate KNN graph from the quality of the final search graph.
- For dynamic systems, report update mix, freshness semantics, latency percentiles, and whether graph repair or rebuild work is on the critical path.
- For SSD dynamic systems, report search-latency fluctuation over time, peak memory during merge/update maintenance, disk space amplification, and write amplification.

## Benchmark Coverage Needed For Future ANN Work

| Claim type | Minimum comparison surface |
|---|---|
| In-memory ANN algorithm | ANN-Benchmarks-style recall-QPS plus build time and memory; include graph and non-graph baselines when metric/dataset support permits. |
| Graph pruning/routing idea | Component-level ablation against HNSW/NSG/Vamana-style baselines. |
| KNN graph construction idea | Graph construction recall, build time, construction memory, and downstream search impact after pruning. |
| Angular/cosine LSH claim | FALCONN/hyperplane-LSH-style baselines plus graph baselines at matched recall. |
| Billion-scale SSD/second-tier system | DiskANN/SPANN plus memory footprint, I/O, and cost/QPS. |
| GPU vector search beyond HBM | BANG/RUMMY/CAGRA-like GPU baselines plus PCIe/cache behavior. |
| Streaming or fresh updates | SPFresh/FreshDiskANN/OdinANN-style baselines plus insert/delete throughput, recall drift, latency fluctuation, peak memory, and update-maintenance interference. |
| Vector database or filtered search | VBASE/Milvus-style query semantics and filter-selectivity tests. |

## Open Questions

- What should be the default streaming benchmark for ANN now that ANN-Benchmarks is primarily in-memory and static?
- Can graph-component metrics from the 2021 survey be integrated with modern hardware counters such as GPU cache miss rate or SSD I/O amplification?
- Which result should be treated as the user-facing metric: average QPS, tail latency at fixed QPS, or cost/QPS at matched recall?
