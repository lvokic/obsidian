# Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search

## Summary

ANN search in this vault spans three layers: compression methods, graph/index methods, and systems/memory-tier co-design.

- **Compression-driven:** PQ, RaBitQ, TurboQuant, ScaNN, and FAISS SQ8/PQ.
- **Scalar/binary quantization:** low-precision KNN, norm-explicit MIPS, scalar-quantized HNSW, and binary/extreme-compression variants.
- **Graph-index methods:** HNSW, NSG, Vamana/DiskANN, now grounded by a proximity-graph-theory branch covering NN-Descent/KGraph, GNNS, NSW, EFANNA, FANNG, DPG, NGT/ONNG, MRNG, SSG, RNN-Descent, and RNSG.
- **Systems/memory-tier:** DiskANN, SPANN, Starling, SPFresh, and OdinANN for SSD/DRAM+SSD; RUMMY and BANG for GPU/host-memory execution; GustANN and FusionANNS for SSD+GPU collaboration; SmartANNS for SmartSSD/NDP; and CXL-ANNS/d-HNSW for disaggregated memory.
- **Production systems:** FAISS as a library baseline and Milvus as a vector DBMS reference.
- **Query semantics and freshness:** VBASE for vector-relational query processing, SPFresh for incremental cluster-index updates, and OdinANN for direct inserts into an SSD-resident graph index.
- **Evaluation infrastructure:** ANN-Benchmarks for in-memory Pareto evaluation, Graph-Based ANNS Survey 2021 for graph-component attribution, and SVFusion/SPFresh-style streaming metrics for update-heavy systems.
- **Non-graph baselines:** FLANN and FALCONN keep the benchmark layer connected to tree/auto-tuning and LSH/angular-distance methods.
- **Execution-layer optimization:** SIMD/vectorization sources track CPU execution details behind distance kernels, PQ/ADC FastScan, compressed ID/list scans, cache-aware batching, and filtered/irregular traversal.
- **Construction/refinement acceleration:** Flash targets HNSW-style graph construction with compact SIMD-friendly build-time codes; Panorama targets exact final refinement with learned orthogonal transforms and partial-distance bounds.
- **RAG and multi-vector retrieval serving:** Chameleon disaggregates IVF-PQ vector search from LLM inference, while WARP optimizes XTR/ColBERT-style multi-vector retrieval with compressed residuals and score reduction.
- **Vector DB interoperability:** Vector Database Integration adds the cross-embedding-model problem: top-k search over vectors produced by different embedding models.

## Current View

**Library baseline:** [FAISS](../entities/faiss.md) is the canonical ANN library, including HNSW, IVF/PQ/SQ variants, and refinement patterns that recur across many ANN systems.

**In-memory state of the art:** [ScaNN](../entities/scann.md), [HNSW](../entities/hnsw.md), and [NSG](../entities/nsg.md) define the high-recall in-memory frontier. [Patience in Proximity](../entities/patience-in-proximity.md) adds a lightweight early-termination branch directly relevant to HNSW traversal.

**Graph-theoretic foundations:** [Proximity Graph Theory for ANN](proximity-graph-theory-for-ann.md) collects the graph-theory layer behind graph ANN search: small-world navigability, approximate Delaunay intuition, monotonic search networks, MRNG, SSG, RNG Strategy, and range-aware RRNG/RNSG. This branch explains why graph quality is not just degree count or diameter; local search must be able to find useful paths.

**Graph ANN taxonomy:** [Graph-Based ANNS Survey 2021](../source-notes/graph-based-anns-survey-2021.md) provides a component-level comparison of graph ANN methods, useful for separating base graph choice, neighbor selection, connectivity repair, seed selection, and routing.

**Graph construction and pruning lineage:** [NN-Descent](../entities/nn-descent.md) supplies the KNNG construction primitive behind KGraph-style baselines and many refinement pipelines. [GNNS](../entities/gnns.md) captures the early random-start hill-climbing pattern. [EFANNA](../entities/efanna.md) shows how tree initialization improves construction and query seeds. [FANNG](../entities/fanng.md), [DPG](../entities/diversified-proximity-graph.md), and [NGT/ONNG](../entities/ngt-onng.md) connect practical pruning, degree control, and alternative-path removal to RNG/MRNG-style thinking.

**Benchmarking methodology:** [ANN Benchmarking Methodology](ann-benchmarking-methodology.md) now captures how to compare ANN systems across implementation benchmarking, graph-component attribution, and hardware/update-aware system evaluation. This prevents in-memory ANN-Benchmarks results from being overused as evidence for SSD, GPU, CXL, or streaming systems.

**SIMD/vectorization layer:** [SIMD and Vectorization for ANN Systems](simd-and-vectorization-for-ann-systems.md) collects execution-model papers relevant to ANN kernels. The main lesson is that SIMD wins depend on the bottleneck: dense distance scans and compressed decoding are SIMD-friendly, while graph traversal, sparse loads, and branch-heavy filters can erase SIMD gains.

**Scalar and binary quantization layer:** [Scalar and Binary Quantization for ANN](scalar-and-binary-quantization-for-ann.md) separates SQ/int8, binary, norm-explicit, RaBitQ-style, and graph-integrated quantization. The key design question is where quantized distances are used: traversal, first-stage filtering, final scoring, or only memory reduction.

**PQ/ADC execution branch:** [PQ Fast Scan](../entities/pq-fast-scan.md) and [Quicker ADC](../entities/quicker-adc.md) show that PQ lookup-table scoring has its own hardware bottleneck. Cache-resident tables are not enough if ADC still performs many irregular table reads; in-register SIMD lookup can change the search-time Pareto frontier.

**Graph plus quantization branch:** [SymphonyQG](../entities/symphonyqg.md) shows how quantization and graph traversal can be co-designed by colocating neighbor codes, using FastScan batches, eliminating explicit reranking, and aligning graph degree with SIMD batch size. [AQR-HNSW](../entities/aqr-hnsw.md) and [HNSW-LAVQ](../entities/hnsw-lavq.md) are lower-confidence recent scalar-quantized HNSW proposals.

**Build-time compact coding:** [Flash Graph Indexing](../entities/flash-graph-indexing.md) separates graph construction from query-time search. Its main lesson is that HNSW build acceleration needs compact codes, neighbor-code placement, and SIMD distance-table layout that preserve construction comparisons, not merely smaller vectors.

**Exact refinement acceleration:** [Panorama](../entities/panorama.md) focuses on the verification stage after candidate generation. It uses learned orthogonal transforms and Cauchy-Schwarz distance bounds to avoid full-dimensional exact scoring for candidates that cannot enter the current top-k.

**Classical non-graph baselines:** [FLANN](../entities/flann.md) remains the canonical randomized KD-tree / k-means-tree auto-tuning library baseline. [Multi-Probe LSH](../entities/multi-probe-lsh.md) is the classical LSH space-time tradeoff source that probes multiple likely buckets per table. [FALCONN](../entities/falconn.md) is the practical cross-polytope LSH baseline for angular/cosine distance.

**RAG and multi-vector retrieval engines:** [Chameleon RALM](../entities/chameleon-ralm.md) uses disaggregated FPGA memory nodes for IVF-PQ search while GPUs run LLM inference and IVF-list selection. [WARP Multi-Vector Retrieval](../entities/warp-multi-vector-retrieval.md) accelerates XTR/ColBERT-style late interaction with WARPSELECT, implicit decompression, and two-stage score reduction.

**SSD/second-tier tier:** [DiskANN](../entities/diskann.md), [SPANN](../entities/spann.md), [Starling](../entities/starling.md), [SPFresh](../entities/spfresh.md), and [OdinANN](../entities/odinann.md) show how ANN systems adapt to storage tiers with high latency, coarse access granularity, segment constraints, and fresh-update pressure. OdinANN adds a graph-specific direct-insert path that trades SSD overprovisioning and write amplification for lower merge interference and lower peak DRAM than buffered inserts. SPANN remains the key DRAM+SSD comparison point.

**GPU/host-memory tier:** [RUMMY](../entities/rummy.md), [BANG](../entities/bang.md), and [SVFusion](../entities/svfusion.md) address datasets beyond GPU memory by coordinating host memory, GPU HBM, and PCIe transfer. RUMMY does this for IVF query processing; BANG does it for graph ANNS with compressed vectors on GPU; SVFusion adds streaming updates and CPU-GPU-disk consistency.

**SSD+GPU tier:** [GustANN](../entities/gustann.md) and [FusionANNS](../entities/fusionanns.md) show a newer heterogeneous branch. GustANN keeps graph traversal GPU-centric while using CPU-assisted selective SSD transfer; FusionANNS combines CPU/GPU filtering with selective raw-vector reranking and SSD I/O deduplication. Both papers turn the accurate/raw-vector stage into an explicitly scheduled data-movement problem.

**Near-data, database semantics, and interoperability:** [SmartANNS](../entities/smartanns.md) moves graph search into SmartSSDs and uses the host as a global coordinator. [VBASE](../entities/vbase.md) is not a storage-tier paper, but it clarifies how vector indexes should integrate with relational operators through relaxed monotonicity. [Vector Database Integration](../entities/vector-database-integration.md) adds the cross-embedding-model setting where vectors from different models must be aligned before a shared top-k search can be meaningful.

**CXL/disaggregated tier:** [CXL-ANNS](../entities/cxl-anns.md) explores hardware/software co-design for CXL ANN. [d-HNSW](../entities/d-hnsw.md) targets RDMA-disaggregated HNSW.

**Near-memory:** [ANSMET](../entities/ansmet.md) uses near-memory processing and hybrid early termination, giving a useful contrast for where computation happens.

## Key System Progression

DiskANN/SPANN show how to survive SSD latency with coarse-grained access. Starling refines SSD graph search at the data-segment layout level. SPFresh extends the SSD/cluster branch to fresh updates, while OdinANN extends the SSD/graph branch to direct inserts with approximate concurrency control. RUMMY/BANG show how to use a GPU when the full dataset or graph cannot fit in HBM. SVFusion adds a newer streaming branch where GPU/CPU/disk placement and update consistency are part of the ANN protocol. GustANN/FusionANNS show how GPU collaboration can improve SSD-backed search when PCIe movement is carefully controlled. SmartANNS shows the near-data-processing branch. CXL-ANNS shows what custom CXL endpoint compute can do, while d-HNSW shows how graph traversal changes under RDMA-style memory disaggregation.

Chameleon adds a RAG-serving variant of this progression: IVF-list selection and LLM inference remain GPU-friendly, while large PQ-code scan work moves into FPGA-attached memory nodes. WARP adds the multi-vector retrieval serving branch, where the bottleneck is compressed token retrieval plus score aggregation rather than a single-vector graph or IVF lookup alone.

## Open Questions

- At what dataset scale and hardware budget does DRAM+CXL outperform DRAM+SSD?
- Can FAISS `IndexHNSWSQ` and `IndexRefine` establish a clean in-DRAM SQ8 baseline?
- How robust are current benchmark claims under mixed workloads with frequent inserts/updates?
- Which baselines are mandatory for a paper claim: pure TopK only, filtered queries, fresh updates, or batch throughput?
- When should graph pruning be justified through MRNG/SSG/RNG theory rather than only empirical recall-latency curves?
- What benchmark should be the default for streaming ANN now that update freshness, recall drift, and tail latency matter?
- For dynamic SSD graph indexes, when is direct insert preferable to buffered insert plus merge, given SSD space/write amplification, peak DRAM, and latency-stability constraints?
- At matched recall, when does scalar-quantized HNSW beat PQ/ADC or graph-plus-FastScan designs?
- Which quantized ANN claims require raw-vector reranking, and which methods can avoid raw vectors entirely?
- When should an ANN system optimize graph construction, as in Flash, rather than only query-time traversal or final refinement, as in Panorama?
- How should vector databases handle embedding-model migration and federation when vectors cannot simply be unioned across models?
- When should RAG serving use a disaggregated vector-search accelerator instead of scaling GPUs or CPUs in a monolithic serving node?
