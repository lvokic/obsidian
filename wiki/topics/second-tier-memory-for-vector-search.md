# Second-tier Memory for Vector Search

## Summary

This topic tracks ANN designs that treat memory capacity as the bottleneck. SSD-centered indexes optimize for coarse-grained storage access and update interference, GPU/host-memory systems optimize PCIe scheduling, SmartSSD systems move compute into storage, and CXL approaches can revisit finer-grained graph traversal because the memory tier is byte-addressable and far lower latency than SSD.

## Current View

- [DiskANN](../entities/diskann.md) is the canonical SSD-resident graph baseline using Vamana plus compression.
- [SPANN](../entities/spann.md) is the strongest DRAM+SSD IVF-style baseline and remains essential for positioning any CXL ANN paper.
- [Starling](../entities/starling.md) refines disk-resident graph search for vector database segments by combining in-memory navigation graphs, reordered disk graph layout, and block search.
- [SPFresh](../entities/spfresh.md) adds the update-freshness dimension for disk-based vector search through in-place incremental rebalancing.
- [OdinANN](../entities/odinann.md) adds a direct-insert branch for SSD-resident graph indexes: it avoids buffered-insert merge spikes by using overprovisioned fixed-size records and approximate concurrency control.
- [RUMMY](../entities/rummy.md) and [BANG](../entities/bang.md) cover host-memory plus GPU execution when the full dataset or graph cannot fit in GPU memory.
- [SVFusion](../entities/svfusion.md) adds a streaming CPU-GPU-disk branch: hot vectors/subgraphs in GPU HBM, complete graph coordination in CPU memory/disk, and update consistency across tiers.
- [GustANN](../entities/gustann.md) and [FusionANNS](../entities/fusionanns.md) add the SSD+GPU branch: both reduce the cost of billion-scale search by keeping large data on SSD while using GPU selectively.
- [SmartANNS](../entities/smartanns.md) adds the SmartSSD/NDP branch, where computation is moved into commercial computational-storage devices.
- The performance/index-size dilemma paper argues that SSD access granularity drives throughput amplification in billion-scale search.
- CXL memory characterization provides the hardware basis for a different design point: random access is still costly compared with DRAM, but feasible enough that HNSW-style traversal can be redesigned rather than abandoned.

## Tier Comparison

| Tier | Latency | Access | ANN design pressure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local DRAM | tens of ns | random-friendly | HNSW, ScaNN, FAISS in-memory |
| CXL memory | tens to low hundreds of ns depending on hardware | random-tolerant but bandwidth-sensitive | CXL-aware ANN placement, caching, scheduling, or device-side co-design |
| NVM/Optane | hundreds of ns | mixed | hybrid layouts |
| SSD/NVMe | 100-200 us | sequential-friendly | IVF posting lists, beam/search batching |
| SSD/NVMe with online updates | 100-200 us plus write/merge interference | coarse pages with expensive random writes | direct insert, buffered delete, update combining, latency-stability evaluation |
| SSD + GPU | SSD latency plus PCIe transfer | high throughput if batched and transfer-efficient | GustANN/FusionANNS-style collaborative filtering, selective transfer, and rerank deduplication |
| Host memory + GPU | DRAM latency plus PCIe transfer | high throughput if transfer/computation overlap | RUMMY/BANG-style batching, compressed GPU state, and CPU-GPU pipelining |
| CPU-GPU-disk streaming | GPU HBM capacity plus PCIe and update synchronization | high throughput if hot vectors stay in HBM and updates avoid global rebuilds | SVFusion-style workload-aware placement, multi-version consistency, and lazy repair |
| SmartSSD/NDP | local SSD/internal-device bandwidth plus FPGA compute | device-local parallelism | SmartANNS-style host coordination, shard pruning, and load-balanced near-data search |

## Open Questions

- At what scale and hardware cost does DRAM+CXL outperform DRAM+SSD?
- Can SPANN-style pruning ideas transfer to CXL-memory ANN systems?
- Can FusionANNS/GustANN-style batching and deduplication ideas transfer across storage and memory tiers without violating latency goals?
- How should memory footprint be compared when CXL reduces DRAM use but still consumes total attached memory?
- How should fresh updates be compared against static-index systems in the same memory-tier taxonomy?
- When should a graph index pay SSD space/write amplification for direct insert instead of buffering updates in DRAM and merging them later?
- Can SVFusion-style cache-placement metrics be reused for CXL or RDMA tiers, where misses are cheaper than SSD but still much slower than local DRAM/HBM?
