# Vector Quantization

## Summary

Vector quantization is the common language across the current source cluster. The shared problem is compressing high-dimensional vectors while preserving the geometric quantity that the downstream system actually uses, such as Euclidean distance or inner products.

## Current Cluster

- [Product Quantization](../entities/product-quantization.md) is the classical retrieval-oriented answer.
- [RaBitQ](../entities/rabitq.md) is a theory-driven retrieval-oriented family built around randomized quantization and strong inner-product error guarantees.
- [QJL](../entities/qjl.md) is an inner-product-preserving sketch for KV caches with zero metadata overhead as a core design goal.
- [TurboQuant](../entities/turboquant.md) tries to unify low-MSE and unbiased inner-product quantization in one online framework.
- [Scalar and Binary Quantization for ANN](scalar-and-binary-quantization-for-ann.md) tracks per-dimension low-precision, binary, and HNSW-oriented quantization.
- [Norm-Explicit Quantization](../entities/norm-explicit-quantization.md) highlights that MIPS needs norm-aware quantization rather than plain MSE minimization.
- [PQ Fast Scan](../entities/pq-fast-scan.md), [Quicker ADC](../entities/quicker-adc.md), and [SymphonyQG](../entities/symphonyqg.md) show that quantization quality and execution layout must be co-designed.
- [Chameleon RALM](../entities/chameleon-ralm.md) shows PQ-code scanning as a hardware/system bottleneck in RAG serving.
- [WARP Multi-Vector Retrieval](../entities/warp-multi-vector-retrieval.md) uses low-bit residual compression for multi-vector retrieval and avoids explicit decompression in the scoring path.

## Working Synthesis

- Older methods are often stronger on mature indexed retrieval pipelines.
- Retrieval now has several distinct branches in this vault: learned codebook methods like PQ, randomized/data-oblivious methods like RaBitQ, scalar/low-precision methods, and graph-integrated quantized search.
- Newer methods focus on online operation, lower metadata overhead, and tighter distortion guarantees.
- The downstream task determines the right distortion target: MSE alone is often not enough.
- Execution matters: a quantizer that looks good on error can still be slow if its distance estimator requires random memory access or poor SIMD utilization.
- Serving context matters: Chameleon uses PQ to fit and scan billion-scale RAG stores near memory, while WARP uses residual quantization to make token-level late interaction feasible.

## Open Questions

- Which distortion target best predicts downstream quality in real systems: MSE, inner-product error, or something task-specific?
- How much of quantization quality comes from geometry-preserving transforms versus learned codebooks and indexing tricks?
- Should scalar quantization be treated as a baseline storage format, a traversal-time distance estimator, or a full replacement for raw-vector reranking?
- When does explicit norm storage or quantization become mandatory for high-quality MIPS?
- Which compressed representations support direct scoring without explicit decompression, as in WARP?
