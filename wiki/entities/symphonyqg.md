# SymphonyQG

## Profile

SymphonyQG is a graph ANN method that integrates RaBitQ-style quantization and FastScan-style SIMD distance estimation into graph traversal and graph construction. The current vault source is the 2024 arXiv version of the paper later accepted by SIGMOD 2025.

## Core Mechanism

- Store neighbor quantization codes next to graph vertices for sequential access.
- Use FastScan to estimate neighbor distances in batches.
- Avoid explicit final reranking by updating exact best candidates during traversal.
- Refine graph degree so each vertex aligns with FastScan batch size.
- Reuse the same search path to accelerate index construction.

## Why It Is Important

SymphonyQG is a concrete example of graph/quantization co-design. It shows that simply adding quantized distance estimates to HNSW-like traversal is not enough; layout, reranking behavior, graph degree, and construction must match the execution kernel.
