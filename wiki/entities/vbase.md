# VBASE

## Profile

VBASE is an OSDI 2023 PostgreSQL-based vector database system that unifies online vector similarity search with relational query processing through relaxed monotonicity.

## Main Ideas

- Treat vector index traversal as approximately monotonic in a two-phase pattern.
- Replace TopK-only vector access with an iterator-style interface.
- Use generalized termination checks to avoid guessing a temporary overfetch K.
- Support hybrid vector/scalar queries, multi-column TopK, range filter, and vector joins.

## Position In The Vault

VBASE is a query-semantics reference rather than a memory-tier design. It is useful when discussing whether billion-scale ANN systems only optimize pure TopK or can serve production database queries with filters and joins.

[RNSG](rnsg.md) is now the closest graph-theoretic neighbor in the vault for filtered vector search: VBASE focuses on vector-relational query processing through relaxed monotonicity, while RNSG focuses on range-filtered graph-index structure.

[Vector Database Integration](vector-database-integration.md) is the closest interoperability neighbor: VBASE assumes vectors are already in a usable search space, while vector database integration asks how to search across databases produced by different embedding models.

## Key Evidence

For complex queries beyond plain TopK, VBASE reports 100x-1000x lower latency than baseline vector systems under similar accuracy. For a join query, it reports about 7900x over PostgreSQL brute-force scan with recall 0.9992.
